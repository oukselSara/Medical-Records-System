Create a visually stunning 3-tier Electronic Medical Records system with an absolutely gorgeous UI using React with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for buttery smooth animations, styled in a dreamy pink aesthetic (primary: #EC4899, secondary: #F9A8D4, accent: #EC4899, background gradients from #FFF1F2 to #FCE7F3 with floating orbs and mesh gradients), Python FastAPI backend, and Firebase (project: medical-records-system-7ce74) for auth and Firestore. Design with modern glassmorphism cards (backdrop-blur-xl, bg-white/30, pink borders with glow effects), floating animations, smooth page transitions, gradient buttons with hover effects that shimmer, animated icons from Lucide React, beautiful shadows and depth layers, curved corners everywhere, micro-interactions on every element (buttons scale and glow on hover, cards lift with shadow changes, inputs have focus animations with pink ring effects). Implement 4 user roles: Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Pharmacist with a breathtaking login page featuring animated gradient background, glass-morphic login card with smooth fade-in, floating particles effect using CSS or a lightweight library. Main dashboard should have an elegant sidebar with icons that animate on hover, gradient avatar badges for user profile, smooth slide-out navigation, and a stunning main content area with animated metric cards showing statistics with count-up animations, beautiful data visualizations using Recharts with pink gradients, and a notification bell with bounce animation and glowing badge. Patient list page needs a gorgeous data table with alternating row colors, smooth hover effects revealing action buttons, elegant search bar with animated search icon, filter dropdown with smooth transitions, and floating action button with ripple effect for adding patients. Patient detail page should be a masterpiece with a hero section showing patient photo and key info in gradient cards, tabbed interface with smooth underline animation, medical history displayed as a beautiful vertical timeline with animated dots and connecting lines, expandable sections with accordion animations, and hovering tooltips with patient vitals shown in colorful badges. Prescription form should have multi-step wizard with progress indicator, animated transitions between steps, medication input with autocomplete dropdown that smoothly appears, beautiful date pickers with pink accents, and a success animation with confetti effect when submitted. Add a Medical Calculator page as the standout feature with three stunning calculator cards arranged in a grid: BMI calculator with animated result gauge showing color zones, drug dosage calculator with interactive sliders and instant visual feedback, and GFR calculator with animated kidney health indicator - all featuring gradient backgrounds, icon animations, smooth number transitions, color-coded results (green/yellow/red) with glow effects, and ability to save results with a sparkle animation. Include floating toast notifications that slide in from top-right with icons and progress bars, loading states with beautiful skeleton screens and shimmer effects, empty states with cute illustrations and encouraging messages, modal dialogs with backdrop blur and scale animations, and form inputs with floating labels that animate up when focused. Navigation should have smooth page transitions using Framer Motion's AnimatePresence, cards should have subtle hover lift effects with shadow expansion, all buttons should have gradient backgrounds with shine effects on hover, and include a theme toggle for light/dark pink modes. Backend is simple FastAPI with Firebase integration, basic CRUD endpoints, JWT verification, and Firestore collections for users, patients, prescriptions, treatments, notifications - keep backend minimal but frontend absolutely gorgeous with every pixel perfect, smooth 60fps animations throughout, and a UI so beautiful it looks like a premium SaaS product with consistent pink theme, perfect spacing, elegant typography using Inter or Poppins font, and professional polish everywhere making it look like it cost thousands to design.
